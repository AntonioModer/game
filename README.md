GHA - Grand Health Auto
=======================

A GTA parody @ GGJ 2013
-----------------------

Grand Health Auto is small parody of GTA where an ambulant driver must rescue
several accident victims due the game. 

The ambulant car driver needs to collect injured victims and brings him to the
hospital for heath recovery (or surgery - who knows). But not becomming
unemployed the driver causes other accicent to keep his job alive and the fun
starts. 

It's an awesome game between live and dead, between heart beats and music,
between caring and greedy. You will love your car and the city. But watch out
for traffic jams!

Gamepad

weird control styles due to different axis/button numbers / axis/button configurations
