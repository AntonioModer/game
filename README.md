GHA - Grand Health Auto
=======================

A GTA parody @ GGJ 2013
-----------------------

Grand Health Auto is small parody of GTA where an ambulant driver must rescue
accident victims (that might have been caused by the player).

The ambulant car driver needs to collect injured victims and bring them to
the hospital for heath recovery (or surgery - who knows). But also to not
become unemployed, the driver may cause accicent to keep his job alive and
the fun starts. 

It's an awesome game between life and dead, between heart beats and music,
between care and greed. You will love your ambulance vehicle, the city, and
the radio stations.

But watch out for traffic jams. And pedestrians. Or maybe not.

Gamepad
------------

The game supports the use of gamepads such as the Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller for Windows,
however it has only been tested successfully with that model, other models are likely to have
weird control styles due to different axis/button numbers / axis / button configurations
